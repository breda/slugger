Slugger is a simple PHP utility class to make slugs out of strings.

While working at [Kreo](https://www.kreo-agency.com/) we needed a slugger utility class to handle French accented characters as well as [Arabic Shadda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadda) and special Arabic characters (like the comma `ØŒ`).

And that's it! This might not be a complete slugger, but this was works for us and I thought I'd share it. 
Any suggestions and feedback are most welcome :-)
